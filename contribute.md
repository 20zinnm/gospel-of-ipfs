Want to help spread the _Holy Gospel of IPFS_? Awesome! Here are some instructions to help you get started.

## Dive Right In

If you'd like to help us right now with the book, feel free to look at the issues for help wanted, or make a PR with your own contribution. There are also comments scattered throughout the book with notes that we should add. Feel free to expand on them or add the content they describe!

## Community Guidelines

IPFS for Smart Dummies falls under the IPFS Community Guidelines.

We want to keep the IPFS community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need your help to keep it that way. To help with this we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

- Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!
- Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.
- Keep it legal: Basically, don't get anybody in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break laws.
- Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.

There is also a more extensiveÂ [code-of-conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
